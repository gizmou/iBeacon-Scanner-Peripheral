# iBeacon Scanner and Peripheral
##iBeacon Scanner
- Detect iBeacons via UUID
- Local notification when iBeacon out of range or in range again (when app in background or closed)
##Peripheral
- Advertise as iBeacon
- Only possible when app is running in foreground (advertising in background mode is currently (iOS8.4) not possible for iBeacons and only limited with corebluetooth - news and/or tests with iOS9 are welcome!)
